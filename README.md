##Installation of steps##
There are a few gems that are being used in this app, which I have inserted into the Gemfile, so if you fork and clone this to run the app locally from your computer, just run bundle install.

##You can find my  user stories, wireframes, and ERD on my Trello board:## https://trello.com/b/uD6wByXp/project-3-awfulix

##Unsolved problems:##
*-search bar only works when on movies page
-error/success (graceful fails) messages for login, signup, searching -movies, submitting, editing, deleting reviews, and viewing movies?
-glyphicons by reviews are no longer showing properly
-some adjustments need to be made on responsive grids
-code could be much DRYer
-validations for users being able to write reviews, see other usersâ€™ profiles, etc*


##future features:
*-seeing reviews a user has made on their profile
-ratings! with trashcans! the bane of my existence!
-allowing users to friend one another (self-referential relationships)
-sharing movies on other social media websites*
